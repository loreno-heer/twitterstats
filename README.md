# twitterstats
Collect Statistics from Twitter Posts

Usage:

1. Enter your twitter username and password in the login file and run that (might need to create a go module first and build the app). Running the file will save a cookie for the app such that further usage won't require a login.
2. In the second file there is a list of tweet ids that you want to monitor. Edit that as you please. Also create the csv file and if desired change its name. If the file does not exist there will be an error. There is a delay between each lookup, change as desired.
3. Build and run the application. Terminate with ctrl+c.
